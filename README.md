# Global Adult Literacy Rate Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes global adult literacy rates by merging data from multiple sources, storing it in a SQLite database, and creating various visualizations to uncover insights about literacy rates across countries, their relationship with GDP per capita, and population size.

## Data Sources

- CSV file: EdStatsData.csv
- Website data
- API data

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- pandas
- sqlite3
- geopandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- fuzzywuzzy
- numpy
- scipy

## Project Structure

1. Data Loading and Cleaning
2. Database Creation (SQLite)
3. Data Merging and Fuzzy Matching
4. Visualization Creation

## Key Visualizations

1. Choropleth Maps: Displaying literacy rates and data collection years by country
2. Bubble Plots: Showing relationships between literacy rates, GDP per capita, and population size
3. Scatter Plots: Illustrating correlations between various factors
4. Box Plots: Displaying rate distribution by population size groups
5. Time Series Plot: Showing literacy rate trends over time

## Ethical Considerations

The project addresses ethical implications of data cleansing and the societal impact of analyzing global literacy rates in relation to economic factors.

## How to Run

1. Ensure all required libraries are installed
2. Update file paths in the code to match your local environment
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate more recent data
- Expand analysis to include additional socio-economic factors
- Improve data visualization techniques for better insights
